Setup development:

Because we use Google APIs for accessing the Google Calendar, we need to follow the Google authentication procedure.
Google requires that developers provide the key that is used for compiling in the Google Developer Console.
To do so, visit the following website:
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?folder=&organizationId=&project=winter-time-228212
Login with email "doorpaneltest@gmail.com" and password "FoxtroTT"
There click on "Create Credentials" and then on "OAuth Client ID". Next select "Android".
Then you are asked to select a name, here you could use anything, but please be so kind and state your real name here, so it is easier for us to manage.
Also you need to provide your key. Google tells you to run
keytool -exportcert -keystore path-to-debug-or-production-keystore -list -v
the path to the keystor should usually be ~/.android/debug.keystore
however I got an error that I can't give 2 commands at the same time, so I removed the -exportcert
So my total command was the following:
keytool -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -list -v
More information is under:

alternatively you can run the gradle task signingReport
Finally you have to choose de.tu_darmstadt.foxtrot.foxtrot_doorpanel_app as Package name
